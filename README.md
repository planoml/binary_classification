# Binary Classification

The examples are generated using chat gpt. 
They demonstrate how the ML algorithms work under the hood using math operations.
Try to understand the code and play with it.
Practice enough number of times to write it yourself with out looking at the original source code.
There is google, and chatgpt for help, but trust me, doing it yourself will improve your understanding, 
and boost confidence on solving new problems.

Run the code and see the output. I use PyCharm, but you could use any IDE.
